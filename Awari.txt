The game "awari" is one of the oldest games in the world,
and it is known by many other names - Kala, Bantumi, and
so on. It's a game of sharing around small objects (rocks,
sea shells, beans, marbles) across a game board which consists
of two lines of indentations, one line on each player's
side. If you're ever on the beach, you'll have everything
at hand to build your own live version of this game.

This version comes with a computer opponent. It basically
tries every possible move, and then chooses the one
yielding the largest amount of beans.

One thing I like about this game is the life lesson that's
hidden in there: Counter-intuitively, one of the most
effective winning strategies is to "give away" as many beans
to the other side as possible.
