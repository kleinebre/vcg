Like Bunny, Love is another program that draws a piece
of ASCII art using alternating "blank" and "nonblank"
characters, with the graphic embedded in a run length
encoded data block. A main difference between Bunny
and this program is that the former has variable line
lengths, while the latter has fixed line lengths,
which means "blank" and "nonblank" stretches can
wrap to the next line. This means there's no need
to define special values as the end of the line,
making this program just a bit tidier than its
counterpart, which also made it just that bit easier
to tweak.

So rather than having a hard-coded line length value
like on line 400 of the original BASIC listing, in
this port I've taken the liberty of adding the
line length before the data block, which gives a bit
more flexibility should you wish to define your own
graphic. I've also defined a few printing styles
for you to try out. The default mirrors the original
program; style number 2 uses a combination of row+
column to decide what letter to print, and style
number 3 will ignore what position we're on and just
repeatedly print the whole message around the spaces,
which is particularly appealing for long messages.
