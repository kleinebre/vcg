Animal was an early expert system. It would
ask you to think of an animal, and it would
then ask yes/no questions to traverse down
a binary tree in an attempt to guess the animal.
If you had thought of an animal not known to
the system, it would ask you about the distinction
between that animal and the last-guessed animal
and create a new entry in the binary tree.

I thought there were two interesting sides to
this implementation. The first was that it could
actually improve its knowledge. The second was
that the original author managed a binary tree
implementation in a language in which support
for data structures was pretty much non-existent.

In its day, due to its ability to extend its
knowledge, this program might have been thought
of as a precursor to artificial intelligence.

These days, there are childrens' toys that run a
similar guessing game, be it about animals or
your favourite character from some movie
franchise's universe.
