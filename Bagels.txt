Bagels is a number guessing game much in the spirit of
mastermind.

To check the amount of unique digits, I've opted
to use a Python set which I felt was a bit cleaner
implementation than used in the original.

Nothing major to report here otherwise; The rules
explain what the program does, the code was in reasonable
shape and the program wasn't particularly big so porting
this wasn't too fussy.
