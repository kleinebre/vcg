Perhaps not particularly useful if you were hoping
for a simulated pair of dice to play Monopoly, but

A charming note in the program is that large numbers
of rolls ("In particular, numbers over 5000") take a
long time. Since this program was originally written,
computer hardware has come a very long way, indeed.
