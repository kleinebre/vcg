The program "Eliza" could be considered one of the first chat bots.
It couldn't possibly pass the turing test, as it has only a small
amount of pre-programmed answers and a very rudimentary understanding
of grammar indeed.

The version given here is somewhat of a free-form port, doing away
with the numeric "data for finding the right replies" data block at
the end of the program, and instead making use of the more flexible
data structures that Python has to offer.

Fast forward a few decades and we have ChatGPT, which is mindbogglingly
far removed from the naive algorithmic approach used by Eliza. But
still, one can't help wonder - if it weren't for Eliza, would ChatGPT
exit at all?
