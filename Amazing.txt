Amazing is a maze generator. It was a bit of a challenge
to port due to some code structure issues; it took me
more time and effort to port this one than it previously
took to write a maze generator from scratch. However, it
was interesting to see how one might go about generating
a maze without recursion, and this maze generator manages
to do just that.
