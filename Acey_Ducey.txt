Acey Ducey is a card game, a game genre that has
seen popularity amongst computer games since the
early days of computing. Conceptually, most of
these games tend to be fairly simple, and a
great many operations and functions used by one
game could be reused in another - be it picking
a card, generating card names, shuffling the
dec and so on. Unsurprisingly, card games have
made their way to desktop computing (solitaire)
and online gambling sites.
