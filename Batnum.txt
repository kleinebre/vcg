Nana nana nana nana BatNum!

It's the BATtle of NUMbers.

There are a few implementations of similar games out
there - you get a pile of matches or whatever, and
the object of the game is to take the last one - or
not. The nice thing about this implementation is
that you can define the starting size of the pile,
the minimum and maximum amount of items one should
take from the pile, and whether the last one taken
counts as a win or a loss. This means that it can
handle pretty much any variation of the game out
there.
