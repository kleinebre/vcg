"king" is a governing style game.

The player is given an objective, and several internal
rules of the game remain mostly hidden to the player,
so the behaviour of the game can be unpredictable.

Sim City is an example of a more recent game based on
the same basic concept.

Porting this game posed no big challenges;
it was one of the more well-structured games in the
book. As such, the game proved relatively easy to port
and easy to read once variable names were chosen.
I did spot a few bugs in the original.

- On line 1105 in the original listing, the code
  jumps to "over a third of the population died"
  when over 50 people starve. Given the population
  starts at around 500, that's 10% so this made no
  sense. I've changed this to jump to said message
  when over 50% of the population dies, which is
  indeed also "over a third of the population".

- Some comparisons are made against variable T1.
  However T1 is never set, so it is always 0.
  Apparently this is used to print a message on
  reasons for declining crop yields, similar to
  the reason for declined tourist trade income - 
  but otherwise it is otherwise inconsequential,
  so I have removed it altogether.

- On line 1450, we have V3=INT(A+V3) which is used
  in the next year to compare tourist trade income.
  That means that for the current year, it should
  be set to the current year's tourist trade income,
  rather than "current money + last year's tourist
  trade income".
