3D plot


This prints a three dimensional plot to the
standard output device, in plain text mode.

The cool thing about this plot is that it does
"hidden lines". The small size of this program
made it easy to port. One important difference
between the original version of the program
and the port is that the port generates the
full line in memory before printing it, rather
than trying to do tab-based printing. This is
a technique carried over to several of the
other ports.
