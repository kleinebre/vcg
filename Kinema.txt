Kinema is an early piece of educational software.
It generates one type of Newtonian physics exercise
and asks the user to solve it, then provides
feedback about the answer. While this is a far cry
from the gamified, colourful educational software
of the present, it can be a useful training tool.

It should be noted that the answers given by this
tool are actually slightly off, since the gravity
constant is taken to be 10 meters per second per
second rather than 9.8, so the result will be less
close to reality and more of a ballpark figure.
The program compensates for this by allowing
answers to be anywhere within 15% of the answer
that is deemed to be correct. It would not have
been a bad idea to define the gravity constant as
G in the program, allowing it not only to be
tuned to the actual physics in effect on Earth,
but also other planets.

In the spirit of educational software, I've left
this as an exercise for the reader.
